## 📌 About This Project

This project is **inspired by the tutorial _“AI Resume Analyzer”_ created by the JavaScript Mastery YouTube channel**.

The original project and step-by-step guide can be found here:  
👉 https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery

I followed the tutorial as a learning exercise to better understand modern frontend development, AI integration, and project structure.  
This repository represents **my own implementation**, adaptations, and learning process based on that material.
